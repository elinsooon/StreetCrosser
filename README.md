Consider a pair of intersections, one with a stop sign and one with a street light. You want to walk from the West side of the stop sign intersection to the NE corner of the street light intersection.

Do you first cross the street at the stop sign to avoid having to cross in both directions at the light? Or wait to cross at the light since there will always be a direction that's green when you get there?

This simulates that problem with a variety of variables such as the light cycle timing and how long it takes to cross each crosswalk. It then plots these values on a graph depicting a pedestrian's time vs. distance covered on a graph for many iterations.

See this link for a sketch of the situation:
